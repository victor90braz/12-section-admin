    ### Project Overview

    This Laravel project is designed for integrating with the Mailchimp API for email marketing purposes. It provides a seamless interface for managing email marketing campaigns in your Laravel application.

    ### Getting Started

    #### Step 1: Clone the Repository

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/victor90braz/11-section.git
    ```

    #### Step 2: Obtain Your Mailchimp API Key

    Obtain your Mailchimp API key from the [Mailchimp API Key page](https://us21.admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/).

    #### Step 3: Configure Laravel Environment Variables

    Add your Mailchimp API key as an environment variable in your Laravel `.env` file:

    ```dotenv
    MAILCHIMP_KEY=cdb9d6462fd76f4dda9277ad935134a4-us21
    ```

    #### Step 4: Configure Laravel Services

    In your Laravel `config/services.php` file, ensure that the Mailchimp configuration is set up correctly:

    ```php
    'mailchimp' => [
        'key' => env('MAILCHIMP_KEY')
    ]
    ```

    #### Step 5: Verify Configuration

    To verify that your Mailchimp configuration is correctly loaded, run the following command in the Laravel Tinker:

    ```shell
    php artisan tinker
    > config('services.mailchimp')
    ```

    #### Step 6: Install the Mailchimp Marketing Library

    Install the Mailchimp Marketing library using Composer:

    ```shell
    composer require mailchimp/marketing
    ```

    #### Step 7: Next Steps

    Follow the [Mailchimp Quick Start Guide](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/quick-start/) to make your first API call and explore more Mailchimp features.

    ### Additional Documentation and Examples

    -   [Mailchimp API Documentation](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/account-exports/)
    -   [Mailchimp Lists API Documentation](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/lists/)

    ### Sample API Calls

    Here are some sample API calls demonstrating how to use the Mailchimp API in your Laravel application.

    1. Add a member to a list:

    ```php
    $response = $client->lists->addListMember("76cf69a4f6", [
        'email_address' => 'maria@gmail.com',
        'status' => 'subscribed'
    ]);
    dd($response);
    ```

    2. Get information about list members:

    ```php
    $response = $client->lists->getListMembersInfo("76cf69a4f6");
    dd($response);
    ```

    3. Get information about a specific list:

    ```php
    $response = $client->lists->getList("76cf69a4f6");
    dd($response);
    ```

    4. Get information about all lists:

    ```php
    $response = $client->lists->getAllLists();
    dd($response);
    ```

    # README for the `MailchimpNewsletter` Class

    ```php

    namespace App\Services;

    use MailchimpMarketing\ApiClient;

    class MailchimpNewsletter {

        public function subscribe(string $email, $list = null) {

            $list ??= config('services.mailchimp.lists.subscribers');

            return $this->client()->lists->addListMember( $list , [
                'email_address' => $email,
                'status' => 'subscribed'
            ]);
        }

        protected function client() {

            return (new ApiClient())->setConfig([
                'apiKey' => config('services.mailchimp.key'),
                'server' => 'us21',
            ]);
        }
    }

    ```

    ## Using Dependency Injection

    Alternatively, you can utilize dependency injection to make your code more elegant and maintainable. Here's how to use the `MailchimpNewsletter` class with dependency injection:

    ```php

    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use App\Services\MailchimpNewsletter;
    use Exception;
    use Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException;

    class NewsletterController extends Controller
    {
        public function __invoke(MailchimpNewsletter $newsletter)
        {
            request()->validate(['email' => 'required|email']);

            try {
                $newsletter->subscribe(request('email'));
            } catch (Exception $e) {
                throw ValidationException::withMessages([
                    'email' => 'This email could not be added to our newsletter list.'
                ]);
            }

            return redirect('/')
                ->with('success', 'You are now signed up for our newsletter!');
        }
    }

    ```

    ## Integration in Laravel Routes

    To implement the `MailchimpNewsletter` functionality in your Laravel routes, you can add the following route definition in your `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php` file:

    ```php
    Route::post('/newsletter', (NewsletterController::class));
    ```

# Newsletter Subscription System

## Logic Overview

This document outlines the architecture and key components of a newsletter subscription system within a Laravel application. The system involves the following components:

-   Interface
-   Controller
-   Implementation classes
-   Binding in the Laravel service container

## 1. Interface Declaration (Newsletter)

An interface named `Newsletter` is declared, specifying the contract for newsletter subscriptions.

```php
interface Newsletter {
    public function subscribe(string $email, string $list = null);
}
```
````

## 2. NewsletterController

A Laravel controller, `NewsletterController`, is defined, extending the base `Controller` class.

```php
class NewsletterController extends Controller {
    public function __invoke(Newsletter $newsletter) {
        // Controller logic
    }
}
```

The controller expects an instance of a class implementing the `Newsletter` interface through dependency injection.

## 3. MailchimpNewsletter Class

The `MailchimpNewsletter` class is declared, implementing the `Newsletter` interface, providing an implementation for the `subscribe` method.

```php
class MailchimpNewsletter implements Newsletter {
    // Implementation of the subscribe method
}
```

## 4. Binding Implementation to Interface

In this section, a binding between the `Newsletter` interface and a concrete implementation is configured within the Laravel service container.

```php
app()->bind(Newsletter::class, function () {
    // Configuration and creation of the MailchimpNewsletter instance
});
```

This configuration allows the application to provide an instance of the `MailchimpNewsletter` class when the `Newsletter` interface is requested.

## Observations

-   The code follows a dependency injection pattern, making the system flexible and testable.
-   The system is configured to use the Mailchimp API for newsletter subscriptions, and the concrete implementation is `MailchimpNewsletter`.
-   Laravel's service container manages the binding of the `Newsletter` interface to the `MailchimpNewsletter` class, allowing for easy switching between newsletter providers.
-   This code is suitable for a Laravel application and is typically defined in a service provider.

This README provides an overview of the newsletter subscription system's key components and their interactions within the application.
